# Reflection

In my opinion, C language is much more difficult to use for begginers compared to Python. The reason for this is Python was created much later than C for the purpose of making coding simpler and more applicable without losing functionality. Despite being more difficult to opperate, C is still valued more in hardware programming, where Python is more for general purposes programming.

The major difference I find challenging to overcome when learning C is datatypes. When programming in Python one does not concern over identifying datatypes, because most of it is done automatically. On the other hand, C requires the programmer to identify the datatypes for every variables. Although it is a hassle to figure out the best datatype for each variables, it could saves more memory compared and compute more efficiently compared to Python.

Learning C language helps us to understand the way the computer functions. Python's simpler language and style come in handy for programming, but it doesn't show much about how the commands/codes are operating the system. However, C language is more linear and straight to the point. One can argue that to become a software programmer doesn't require you to learn C, yet I still hold firm the belief that it is the base of many languages and to learn to code is to learn to understand how the computer works, and that process can't be done without something like C.

There will be thousands of simpler and more efficient languages in the future and it is almost certain that C won't be as popular, but it will never lose it's importance and educational value.
